                        <div class="accordion-body">Most of us welcome hot weather, but when it's too hot, there are health risks. During heatwaves, more people than usual get seriously ill or die. If hot weather hits this summer, make sure it does not harm you or anyone you know.

                            Why is a heatwave a problem?
                            The main risks posed by a heatwave are:

                            not drinking enough water (dehydration)
                            overheating, which can make symptoms worse for people who already have problems with their heart or breathing
                            heat exhaustion and heatstroke
                            Who's most at risk?
                            A heatwave can affect anyone, but the most vulnerable people are:

                            older people – especially those over 75 and female
                            those who live on their own or in a care home
                            people who have a serious or long-term illness including heart or lung conditions, diabetes, kidney disease, Parkinson's disease or some mental health conditions
                            people who are on multiple medicines that may make them more likely to be badly affected by hot weather
                            those who may find it hard to keep cool – babies and the very young, the bed bound, those with drug or alcohol addictions or with Alzheimer's disease
                            people who spend a lot of time outside or in hot places – those who live in a top-floor flat, the homeless or those whose jobs are outside
                            Tips for coping in hot weather
                            Keep out of the heat if you can. If you have to go outside, stay in the shade especially between 11am and 3pm, wear sunscreen, a hat and light clothes, and avoid exercise or activity that makes you hotter.

                            Cool yourself down. Have cold food and drinks, avoid alcohol, caffeine and hot drinks, and have a cool shower or put cool water on your skin or clothes.

                            Keep your living space cool. Close windows during the day and open them at night when the temperature outside has gone down. Electric fans can help if the temperature is below 35 degrees. Check the temperature of rooms, especially where people at higher risk live and sleep.

                            For more information visit GOV.UK: Beat the heat: staying safe in hot weather.

                            You can also get help from the environmental health office at your local council, if you think a hot house is affecting your health or someone else's. They can inspect a rented home for hazards to health, including excess heat.

                            Find your local council (GOV.UK)

                            Watch out for signs of heat-related illness
                            If you or someone else feels unwell with a high temperature during hot weather, it may be heat exhaustion or heatstroke.</div>

                            Who's most at risk from cold weather?
                            Some people are more vulnerable to the effects of cold weather. This includes:

                            people aged 65 and older
                            babies and children under the age of 5
                            people on a low income (so cannot afford heating)
                            people who have a long-term health condition
                            people with a disability
                            pregnant women
                            people who have a mental health condition
                            Get advice if you feel unwell
                            If you're 65 or over, or in one of the other at-risk groups, it's important to get medical help as soon as you feel unwell.

                            You can get help and advice from:

                            a pharmacy – pharmacists can give treatment advice for a range of minor illnesses and can tell you if you need to see a doctor
                            your GP – you may be able to speak to a GP online or over the phone, or go in for an appointment if they think you need to
                            NHS 111 – go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111 if you have an urgent medical problem and you are not sure what to do
                            The sooner you get advice, the sooner you're likely to get better.

                            In an emergency, go to A&E immediately or call 999.</div>

                            1. Could your property be at risk of flooding?
                            Follow this three-point plan to check and be prepared:

                            Check if your property is at risk.
                            If you are at risk, take the next two steps to protect your property when you need to:

                            Prepare a flood plan
                            Prepare an emergency flood kit
                            2. Staying safe in flooding
                            It's never too late to take action and prepare for flooding. Follow these 6 simple steps to protect your home or business:

                            Check the flood advice in your area to know when and where flooding will happen
                            Charge mobile phone devices
                            Park your car outside the flood zone
                            Prepare a flood kit to help you cope in the event of flooding to your home and business
                            Store valuables up high, including electrical devices, important documents and furniture
                            Turn off gas water and electricity supplies
                            If you are trapped in a building by floodwater, follow these simple instructions to keep you and your family safe:

                            Go to the highest level in the building you are in
                            Do not go into attic spaces to avoid being trapped by rising water
                            Only go to a roof if necessary
                            Call 999 and wait for help
                            More about what to do in a flood

                            3. Is it safe for you to drive?
                            It is safer not to drive in these conditions but if you must drive you can do this more safely by:

                            Slowing down
                            Using main roads
                            Using dipped headlights
                            Giving yourself more time to react on slippery surfaces
                            Keeping a bigger gap between vehicles
                            More about driving in severe weather

                            4. What about flood water?
                            It is not safe to drive or walk or swim through floodwater, avoid it where possible and if you are affected by fast flowing or deep water call 999 and wait for help.

                            5. Thinking about your neighbours
                            Help to protect the vulnerable people that you know, including older people, those with underlying conditions and those who live alone: they may need support with food and medical supplies.

                            If you are worried about your health or that of somebody you know, ring NHS 111.

                            Be prepared for weather warnings to change quickly. When a weather warning is issued, stay up to date with the weather in your area.

                        <div class="accordion-body">When there is a wind warning in place, here are some things you can do...

                            1. Protecting your property from damage and other people from injury
                            Don't risk injury to others or damage to your property. Check for loose items outside your home and plan how you could secure them in high winds.
                            Items include:

                            bins
                            plant pots
                            garden furniture (bring inside or secure in place)
                            trampolines (turn upside down or secure with tent pegs)
                            sheds (ensure doors are locked)
                            2. Things you can do before a journey
                            Windy weather can cause delays and make driving conditions dangerous. Follow these few simple steps to prepare before journeys:

                            Plan your route, check for delays and road closures
                            Listen out for travel updates on your car radio/sat nav
                            If you don't have essentials in your car then pack for the worst (warm clothing, food, drink, blanket, torch)
                            Take a fully charged mobile phone with an in-car charger or battery pack
                            3. Driving safely in strong wind
                            Driving in these conditions can be dangerous, for yourself and other road users. If you must drive, you can do this more safely by:

                            Driving slowly to minimise the impact of wind gusts
                            Be aware of high sided vehicles/caravans on more exposed roads
                            Be cautious overtaking high sided vehicles/caravans
                            Make sure you hold the steering wheel firmly
                            Give cyclists, motorcyclists, lorries and buses more room than usual
                            More about travelling in storms, rain and heavy wind

                            4. Staying safe when you're at the coast
                            If you live or work on the coast take extra care during windy and stormy weather. Keep yourself and others safe by following these simple steps:

                            Check the forecasts and tides in your local area here
                            Beware of large waves, even from the shore large breaking waves can sweep you off your feet and out to sea
                            Take care if walking near cliffs – know your route and keep dogs on a lead
                            In an emergency 999 (UK) or 112 (Ireland) and ask for the Coastguard
                            5. Avoiding injury if you're out and about
                            Being outside in high winds makes you more vulnerable to injury. Stay indoors as much as possible. If you do go out, try not to walk or shelter close to buildings and trees.

                            Be prepared for weather warnings to change quickly. When a weather warning is issued, stay up to date with the weather in your area.

                            What is hay fever?
                            Hay fever (seasonal allergic rhinitis) is an allergy caused by pollen grains released during the pollen season which normally runs from March to November in the UK.

                            Hay fever symptoms
                            Common hay fever symptoms include sneezing, runny or blocked nose, itchy eyes, mouth and throat. Less common hay fever symptoms are headaches and hives.

                            There are many myths surrounding lightning - such as lightning never strikes the same place twice or it always strikes the tallest object. Both are false, as lightning strikes the best conductor on the ground - whether it has been struck before or not.

                            Make sure you know what to do
                            Thunderstorms can occur at any time of the year but it is during the summer months when thunderstorms in the UK are most likely to produce large hail, gusty winds and torrential downpours that can cause disruption to transport networks and damage property.

                            One of the most notable aspects of thunderstorms can be the localised nature of the impacts they could bring. This, in particular, can be the case with rainfall amounts, with big differences in amounts that fall from one place to another and over a very short distance. This can make driving conditions very hazardous. Other hazards include hail, decreased visibility, sudden gusty winds, standing water and of course lightning.

                            Before the thunderstorm
                            Lightning can cause power surges, unplug any non-essential appliances if not already using a surge protector.
                            Seek shelter if possible. When you hear thunder you are already within range of where the next ground flash may occur, lightning can strike as far as 10 miles away from the centre of a storm.
                            During the thunderstorm
                            Telephone lines can conduct electricity so try to avoid using the landline, unless in an emergency
                            If outside avoid water and find a low-lying open place that is a safe distance from trees, poles or metal objects
                            Avoid activities such as golf, rod fishing or boating on a lake
                            Be aware of metal objects that can conduct or attract lightning, including golf clubs, golf buggies, fishing rods, umbrellas, motorbikes, bicycles, wheelchairs, mobility scooters, pushchairs, wire fencing and rails. If you are in a tent, try to stay away from the metal poles
                            If you find yourself in an exposed location it may be advisable to squat close to the ground, with hands on knees and with head tucked between them. Try to touch as little of the ground with your body as possible, do not lie down on the ground
                            If you feel your hair stand on end, drop to the above position immediately
                            After the thunderstorm
                            Avoid downed power lines or broken cables
                            If someone is struck by lightning, they often suffer severe burns. The strike also affects the heart, so check if they have a pulse.
                            Driving in a thunderstorm
                            If you are caught out in thunder and lightning it is advised that you wind up the windows and stay inside your car. This is because in the vast majority of cars with a metal roof and frame, the frame will act as a conductive Faraday cage, passing the current around the passengers inside and on to the ground.

                            Soft-top convertibles, with their fabric roofs, are the most at risk and could catch fire if struck by lightning
                            Be aware that current can travel through other parts of many modern cars, including GPS and radio systems. Cars with metal interior handles, foot pedals and steering wheels can also carry current
                            Cars can be damaged both internally and externally by lightning strikes
                            Thunderstorms can also bring a risk of sudden gusty winds, those most at risk would include cyclists, motorcyclists and high sided vehicles.

                            Remember to give vulnerable road users including cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians more room than usual. They are more likely to be blown around by side winds – always keep a safe distance.
                            Keep your speed down, lowering your speed will lower the distance you travel when buffeted around by the wind.
                            Hail storms can be extremely dangerous to drive in reducing your ability to see and be seen, as well as causing damage to your vehicle. If hail is severe, stop and pull over to a safe place and remain inside the vehicle</div>
